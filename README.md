## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete invoices
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit an invoice
- Save draft invoices, and mark pending invoices as paid
- Filter invoices by status (draft/pending/paid)
- Toggle light and dark mode
- Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage`)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) - Build tool
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) - For routing
- [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) - For state management

### Continued development

I plan on adding a backend to this project, so the users can login and save their invoices in a database, rather than storing them locally (localStorage).
